header/footer handling
- needs to check user id in document.cookie and respond with a dynamic account replacement or do nothing if document.cookie contains an id='0'

/registerhandler
- needs to respond with one of a few options:
  a string containing 'An account with that name already exists.' or similar message
  a string containing 'The passwords you have entered do not match.' or similar message
  a string containing 'Account registered!' or similar message followed by a session id followed by a page to redirect to
    example: 'Account registered!; 901877653; /account'

/auth
- needs to respond with one of two options:
  a string containing 'Incorrect username or password.'
  a string containing a confirmation message followed by a session id followed by a page to redirect to
    example: 'Welcome back, testificatealice; 901872345; /account'

/res
- resources need to be stored serverside
- if the filepath of resources are changed they will need to be changed inline

Content is stored inside a container that is fairly simple to replicate
Page Layout:
- Header - with appropriate changes if user id is not '0'
- Content
- Footer - served dynamically
