header/footer handling
- needs to check user id in document.cookie and respond with a dynamic account replacement or do nothing if document.cookie contains an id='0'

Content is stored inside a container that is fairly simple to replicate
Page Layout:
- Header - with appropriate changes if user id is not '0'
- Content
- Footer - served dynamically
