                <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1><b>- Why?</b>
                <br>Because I want to make it easier for people to host servers (particularly game servers), play with friends, and connect with others. I've been particularly frustrated with the state of server hosting, you either have to mess around with
                port-fowarding (difficult, many routers can't do it) or pay a company $10-$20 a month to host a server. With Grappl, you can put up a server with no hassle, running off your own machine, in a moment.
                <p><b>- How does it work?</b>
                  <br>It works by tunnelling data through Grappl relay servers. The exact details are complex, but Grappl isn't built with support for any specific protocol, and just works as a dumb TCP tunnel. That means any application that uses TCP and
                  binds to only one port should work through it.
                  <p><b>- Is it safe?</b>
                    <br>It's safe. Nothing nefarious is done with data sent through Grappl.
                    <br>You can also view the source code of the client here: <a style='color:#ffffff' href='https://github.com/Cactose/Grappl'>https://github.com/Cactose/Grappl</a>
                    <p><b>- What applications/games will it run with?</b>
                      <br>It will run on any game that has a TCP client which accepts alternate ports from the default.
                      <br>This includes Minecraft, Starbound, Terraria, and most other games. It can even be used to host HTTP servers!
                      <p><b>- How do you pay to keep this running?</b>
                        <br>Donations, and donations alone! Please <a style='color:#ffffff' href='/donate'>donate</a> if you like Grappl. You can alpha test new features if you do!

                        <p><b>- How can I set up a MC server with Grappl?</b>
                          <br>This video does a great job of explaining how. The explanation starts at 1:10.
                          <br>

                          <br>If you want to host a dedicated server, it's a bit more complicated.
                          <br>You have to download the MC server application from minecraft.net, run it, then enter '25565' as the server port into Grappl.
                          <br>
                          <p><b>- It won't work on my computer, what's wrong?</b>
                            <br>If you don't have Java installed, you need to have that installed.
                            <br>If the application starts, you've let it through your firewall, and you get a public address (but you can't connect to it) any number of things could be wrong, but it's usually just the wrong port was entered.
                            <br>If it's being a total pain, you can contact me at <a style='color:#ffffff' href='https://twitter.com/Cactose'>https://twitter.com/Cactose</a> and I'll look into helping you.
                            <p><b>- Grappl is java? Is there an API?</b>
                              <br>You bet! The documentation is on the github page. It's super simple.
                              <p><b>- Can I run my own relay servers?</b>
                                <br>Absolutely! Contact me at <a href='mailto:matt@daexsys.com'>matt@daexsys.com</a> and we can work out licensing. The serverside is closed source. Self-hosting a relay server can be preferable, for example, if you are a game
                                dev and are using Grappl for your game's networking through the API. You are still free to use the public relay servers in that scenario, but it may not be preferable.
                                <p>
