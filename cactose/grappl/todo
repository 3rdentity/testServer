why waste a user's time querying backend when frontend js could provide errors about:
passwords do not match - backend responds with page detailing error
empty password or username - backend hangs eternally

capsLockTest is broken
- event.charCode in chrome? no event.key?

weird submit button issue on firefox?

'NetworkError: A network error occurred.'?
