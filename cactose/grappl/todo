why waste a normal user's time querying backend when frontend js could provide errors about:
passwords do not match - backend responds with page detailing error
empty password or username - backend hangs eternally

application links to /register. consider loading modal through a get request or getting rid of modals and using actual pages? using both means modifying two or more places of code if one instance changes

MOAR STYLING
 - fix banner underlining and collapsing and dropdowns
 - /index seems compressed
 - /account and /testerAccount are very empty and need more styling
 - /servers needs to actually be stylized
 - modals need better styling
