why waste a normal user's time querying backend when frontend js could provide errors about:
passwords do not match - backend responds with page detailing error
empty password or username - backend hangs eternally

limit ability to submit forms using 'Enter' while ajax is waiting for response

condense functions/refactor

talk to cactose about dynamic file setup. modifying header and dynamicHeader for small changes is cumbersome when the very small change that dynamicHeader makes to header could be supplied in dynamicHeader

MOAR STYLING
 - fix banner underlining and collapsing and dropdowns
 - /index seems compressed
 - /account and /testerAccount are very empty and need more styling
 - /servers needs to actually be stylized
 - modals need better styling
