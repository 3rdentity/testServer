why waste a normal user's time querying backend when frontend js could provide errors about:
passwords do not match - backend parses passwords and sends a response back
empty password or username - backend hangs eternally

application links to /register and /donate. consider loading modal through window.location.href

MOAR STYLING
 - fix banner underlining and collapsing and dropdowns
 - /index seems compressed
 - /account and /testerAccount are very empty and need more styling
 - /servers needs to actually be stylized
 - modals need better styling
